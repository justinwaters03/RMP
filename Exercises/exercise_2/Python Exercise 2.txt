Python Exercise 2
Aim: Create an excel report using generate_strat_report function for the CS strategies with SPTR as the benchmark

Steps:
1. Get the dictionary of returns for the SPTR index using the get_equity_hedge_returns function from datamanager (dm). Name this dictionary sptr_dict
	Hint: import the data_manager (dm) library using:
		from EquityHedging.datamanager import datamanager as dm
2. Import the Credit Suisse stratgies from the "Credit Suisse Systematic Defensive Skew_Index_20220305_out.xlsx" file into a dataframe called cs_data:
	Hint: copy the data into a new sheet so it's easier to import without reformatting (we did this already, the data is in the data sheet file)
3. Create cs_dict which should be a dictionary of frequency of returns of the cs_data
4. Merge the sptr_dict and cs_dict dictionaries with the merge_dicts function from data_manager (dm). Call this new dictionary ret_dict.
	Note: Make sure sptris the first column in all the dataframes in the ret_dict dictionery created
5. Generate the excel strat report ('strat_report_[first_name]') using the generate_strat_report function from reports (rp)
	Hint: import the reports (rp) library using:
		from EquityHedging.reporting.excel import reports as rp
6. Save a copy of the lines of code you used to generate the report as well as the excel report ("strat_report_[first_name].xlsx").
