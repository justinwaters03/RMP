Python Exercise 3
Aim: Create Equity Hedge Analysis reports for different strategies using different benchmarks

notional_weights = [13,1,1,1,1,1,.25,.25]
*notional_weights are in Billions
1. Create an equity hedge analysis report including the Credit Suisse Defensive Skew strategy:
	make the benchmark 'SPTR'
	notional = 1 Billion	
	strategy_list = ['Defensive Skew]
	equity_hedge_report = 'equity_hedge_analysis_cs_def_skew'

2. Create an equity hedge analysis report including the Credit Suisse SMI Dispersion strategy:
	make the benchmark 'M1WD'	
	notional = 0.5
	strategy_list = ['SMI Dispersion']
	equity_hedge_report = 'equity_hedge_analysis_cs_dispersion'

3. Create equity hedge analysis reports including the 3 CS strategies separately
	make the benchmark 'M1WD'
	each strategy has notiional 0.5 Billion
	
	a. strategy_list = ['FVA', 'Def Term Premia', 'FVA + Def Term Premia']
	equity_hedge_report = 'equity_hedge_analysis_cs1'

	b. strategy_list = ['FVA']
	equity_hedge_report = 'equity_hedge_analysis_FVA'

	c. strategy_list = ['Def Term Premia']
	equity_hedge_report = 'equity_hedge_analysis_def_term_premia'

	d. strategy_list = ['FVA + Def Term Premia']
	equity_hedge_report = 'equity_hedge_analysis_fva_term'
